Old man: "'Tis my old donkey, sir. Lost, she is, or stolen, and without her I cannot take my wares to market, and my family will go hungry tonight."
Wizard: "And I am hungry now!"
— The old man and the Wizard[src]
The old man's family were characters in the tale The Wizard and the Hopping Pot by Beedle the Bard. Their donkey either ran away or was stolen, and the old man asked the Wizard to help him, for without the donkey to carry his wares to the market, his family would starve. The Wizard rudely refused to help him.[1]
