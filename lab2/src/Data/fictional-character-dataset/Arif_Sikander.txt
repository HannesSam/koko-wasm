Magical abilities and skills
Muggle Studies: As a professor of Muggle Studies at Hogwarts, Sikander was highly knowledgeable of Muggles and their ways of living.[2][4]
Etymology
Arif is a male Arabic name meaning "knowledgeable" or "wise". Sikandar is the Persian version of the name Alexander, meaning "to defend man".
Behind the scenes
This character appears to have been modeled after an unnamed background character that made an appearance in the first film, suggesting that the two are supposed to be the same person.
Assuming Professor Sikander was offered the post full-time once it became clear that Quirrell would switch subjects rather than return to it, this would also imply that Sikander was the male Muggle Studies professor mentioned in the video game adaption of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
