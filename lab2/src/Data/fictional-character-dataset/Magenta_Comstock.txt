↑ Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery - One of the questions in Badeea Ali's art quiz is about who is on a Chocolate Frog Card and Magenta Comstock is one of the correct answers. Badeea Ali is unlocked as friend in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, Year 5, Chapter 4 (Opposite Day), taking place in the 1988–1989 school year. Later, in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, Year 5, Chapter 9 (Dangerous Friends), Rubeus Hagrid states that his birthday is soon. As Hagrid was born on 6 December, this means all chapters in Year 5 up to Chapter 9 must take place at some point between 1 September 1988 and 6 December in the same year.
