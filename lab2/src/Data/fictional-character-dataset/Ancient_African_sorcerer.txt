This ancient African sorcerer (fl. early 1600s) was a wizard from somewhere in Africa, who was responsible for teaching Eldon Elsrickle, a thief hailing from London, about the Unlocking Charm. The Charm was not known in Great Britain, and when Elsrickle returned, he conducted a series of mysterious robberies, earning him the sobriquet "The Spectral Thief of Old London Town".[1]
