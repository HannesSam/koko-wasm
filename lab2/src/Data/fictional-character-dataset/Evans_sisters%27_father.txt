Biography
Mr Evans and his wife lived in Cokeworth, England.[4] The couple had two daughters: Petunia, born in the late 1950s, and Lily, born 30 January 1960.[5][6]
The couple's elder daughter was a Muggle like them.[7] Their younger daughter, on the other hand, turned out to be a Muggle-born witch.[7] Mr Evans and his wife were proud to have a magical daughter, but Petunia thought differently, considering her sister to be a "freak."[7] According to Petunia, Mr and Mrs Evans favoured Lily, talking about her constantly.[7]
On 1 September, 1971, Mr Evans and his wife took Lily and Petunia to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, in order to see Lily off to her first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[6]
Death and legacy
Mr Evans and his wife died "normal Muggle death[s]" sometime before the murder of their daughter Lily and son-in-law James Potter, on the night of 31 October, 1981.[1][2][3] This meant that their grandson, Harry Potter was left in the care of Petunia, his only surviving blood relation.[8]
