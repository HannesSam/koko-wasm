"They Keeper actually did a nice job with that goalpost."
— Bean[src]
At some point by the 1987–1988 school year, she became the Keeper of her house's Quidditch team. She and other team members got into a confrontation with Jacob's sibling team, after Erika Rath injured Orion Amari in a Quidditch friendly.[3]
After the match with Jacob's sibling's team, which ended in a brawl between the teams, this girl, along with the rest of the players, served detention under the supervision of Rolanda Hooch. The teams managed to prove their dedication to sportsmanship and cooperation and were not disqualified from the competition for the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup.[4]
Behind the scenes
Which house she is in depends on that of Jacob's sibling (chosen by the player). If Jacob's sibling is in Gryffindor, Hufflepuff or Slytherin, this girl is in Ravenclaw. If Jacob's sibling is in Ravenclaw, she is in Slytherin.
