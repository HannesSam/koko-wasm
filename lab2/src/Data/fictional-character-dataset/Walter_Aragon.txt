Biography
Lifetime
At some point in his life, Professor Aragon became the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[3] He also seemed to have an interest in Care of Magical Creatures, as he authored at least one title on the subject, Newts of Bognor.[4]
Post-mortem
Professor Aragon died sometime before 1943.[1] There were portraits of the professor hung at the Grand Staircase[5] and one at the Headmaster's office[3] in order to give advice to the current headmaster.
Behind the scenes
The solo portrait of Aragon was based on a 1896 portrait of The Right Honourable Joseph Chamberlain, by John Singer Sargent (1856–1925).[6]
Aragon's portrait of him by himself only appears at the Headmaster's office in LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) the portrait of Amberose Swott occupies that space, and in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film) and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film) the portrait of Professor Everard is hung there.
In The Making of Harry Potter, Walter Aragon's name appears on the portrait in the Headmasters' Office depicting two headmasters playing chess. Brian Gagwilde is named as the other headmaster.
His motto "Mens sana in corpore sano" is a Latin phrase quotation often translated as "A sound mind in a healthy body."[7]

1.0 1.1 J. K. Rowling stated at the Edinburgh Book Festival on 15 August 2004 (source) that all portraits at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are of deceased individuals. Thus, Aragon must have died sometime in or before 1995, given his portrait's appearance in the Headmaster's office in the LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4.
