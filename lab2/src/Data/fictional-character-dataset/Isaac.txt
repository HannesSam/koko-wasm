Isaac was the second of the three Patriarchs of the Bible.[1] He was the son of Abraham, who, in a well-known Biblical account, was called upon by God to offer him as sacrifice in order to test his faith.[2]
Isaac was mentioned in a book that was kept in the Restricted Section of the library at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry by the 1990s.[2]
Behind the scenes
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the shrieking book, in which Isaac is mentioned, appears to be a copy of The Works of the Most Reverend Dr John Tillotson.
