The fiancé of Honoria was a wizard who worked in the Improper Use of Magic Office. Honoria called off their engagement, telling people it was because she learned "he had a Hairy Heart" (a wizarding expression for an unfeeling person), but rumour had it that she had really been disturbed to catch him in the middle of fondling some Horklumps.[1]
