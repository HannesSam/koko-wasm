[Source]
These eight witches and wizards were siblings of Flora, Hamish and famed rugby player Angus Buchanan, and therefore children of John and Mary Buchanan[2]. The daughters among this group had won the village tug-of-war every year in living memory; all of the children were described as being "enormous" and "wild".[2]
When Angus was disowned by their father upon being rejected by the Sorting Hat as he was a Squib, he placed an edict upon them forbidding them from seeing or talking to their brother again.[2] They, however, revolted, and attended his first rugby match, against England, which he won.[2]
Behind the scenes
In real life, Angus had eleven siblings, rather than ten, and none of them were called Hamish or Flora; their names were Mary (b. 1845), Marjory (b. 1837), Eleanor (b. 1851) , John (b. 1842), Duncan (b. 1839), Duncan Fletcher (b. 1855), Betsy (b. 1840), Margaret Eleanor (b. 1853), Ann (b. 1848), George (b. 1835) and Hugh Peter (b. 1857).[3] Five of these siblings were born after the real-life Angus Buchanan.
