Biography
They were both waiting at King's Cross Station on 1 September, 1996 as a security escort for Harry Potter. Both were described as grim-faced and dressed as Muggles in dark suits. Upon the arrival of Harry and the Weasleys, the Aurors quickly escorted them into the station without speaking, although Harry found his escort's over-protectiveness somewhat irritating.[1]
Behind the scenes
It is possible that one of them was Gawain Robards.
