"You're not the first one who's had trouble with money. I had two try and pay me with great gold coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago."
— Mr Roberts[src]
This unidentified man tried to pay Muggle Mr Roberts with Galleons, or as Roberts described it big gold coins, at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup.[2]
Biography
This man tried to pay with "big gold coins" to get into the Quidditch World Cup Campsite, but was unsuccessful as Roberts was a Muggle and so did not recognise the currency.[2]
Appearances
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (First mentioned)
Notes and references
↑ If he was Muggle-born, he would have likely had more sense than to try to pay a Muggle with Galleons.
