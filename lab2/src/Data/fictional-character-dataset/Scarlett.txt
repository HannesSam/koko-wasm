Scarlett was a Muggle friend of Penny Haywood, who was killed by a werewolf in the summer of 1985.
Biography
Scarlett was presumably born around the same time Penny Haywood was born, in the late 1960s or early 1970s, and was raised in the Muggle world. Every summer, Scarlett and her family would spend the holiday in the countryside, where they befriended Penny and her family.[1]
In the summer of 1985, Scarlett and Penny snuck out of their house at night during the full-moon. They found a werewolf which fascinated Scarlett. Scarlett followed it while Penny followed them with her wand ready. Eventually, the werewolf noticed it was being followed and turned around. It killed Scarlett before Penny had time to react.[1]
Penny later blamed herself for Scarlett's death and decided to brew a Forgetfulness Potion. From then on, Penny's Boggart became the werewolf.[1]
