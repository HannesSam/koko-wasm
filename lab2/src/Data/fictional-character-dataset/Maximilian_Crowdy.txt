Biography
Maximilian Crowdy was the sitting Minister for Magic in 1777, when American wizards argued for and against interventionism in the Revolutionary War. When President Elizabeth McGilliguddy sought the advice of the Ministry of Magic to find out whether they intended to intervene on their side, Minister Crowdy replied with only a four-word message — "Sitting this one out". McGilliguddy replied back with an even shorter message — "Mind you do". Neither MACUSA or the Ministry of Magic intervened in the war.[3]
Behind the scenes
Mr Crowdy is a minor character in Robert Galbraith's The Cuckoo's Calling, a graphic designer who runs Crowdy Graphics, downstairs from Cormoran Strike's office on Denmark Street.
