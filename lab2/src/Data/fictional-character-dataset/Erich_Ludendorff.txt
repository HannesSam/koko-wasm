Erich Ludendorff (9 April 1865 – 20 December 1937) was a German Muggle general during the early 20th century.[1] He lead the German war effort during the latter part of the First World War, and afterward became a prominent nationalist figure, engaging in an unsuccessful coup with Adolf Hitler in 1923.[1]
In a 6 December 1926 interview with the New York Chronicle, former French prime minister Georges Clemenceau revealed some of the things he planned to discuss in a talk scheduled for that evening, including what he saw as the post-war emergence of a "new triple alliance" that threatened the Allied powers.[2][3] According to him, this alliance consisted of "Kemalist Turkey, the reactionary Germany of Ludendorf [sic], and Russia of the Soviets."[2][3]
Behind the scenes
The text of the article mentioning Erich Ludendorff in the prop issue of the New York Chronicle featured in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was taken from the real 21 November 1922 issue of The Evening World.[3] This represents an anachronism, as the film is set in 1926, but the actual Clemenceau speech referenced occurred in 1922.
