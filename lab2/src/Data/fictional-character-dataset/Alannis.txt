— Alannis to Harry after learning Levicorpus[src]

Biography
Alannis was sorted into Ravenclaw when she arrived at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In 1996 Alannis became captain for Ravenclaw when the Duelling Club was revived by Albus Dumbledore as a precaution to help students defend themselves if the event of an attack from Death Eaters or Lord Voldemort was ever to happen. Minerva McGonagall convinced Harry Potter to join the Ravenclaw Duelling Club, introducing him to Alannis, who requested that he showed a group of watching Ravenclaws how to cast Levicorpus. After her duel with Harry she jokingly told him to watch his back as other Ravenclaws might hit him with their newly learnt jinx.[3]
