Mrs Goyle was the wife of Mr Goyle and the mother of Gregory Goyle, a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When members of Dumbledore's Army hexed her son into a large, oozing slug, Ron Weasley joked that she would consider it an improvement on his appearance.[2] It's unknown if she has any involvement with the Death Eaters, though she most likely was not one herself as she was not seen with her husband during Lord Voldemort's revival, but she was still likely loyal to them and their cause.
Appearances
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (First mentioned)

↑ Her son Gregory is a pure-blood from Harry Potter and Me, which means none of his parents or grandparents are Muggles or Muggle-borns.
