"I've seen one of these before. It was at the fair. There was this dame there, and she had a veil. I gave her a nickel and she told me about my future. She missed out on quite a bit, actually."

Notes and references
↑ This woman was almost definitely a No-Maj, as opposed to a witch with talents in Divination, given how she was able to freely liaise with Jacob Kowalski, a No-Maj, in the United States, and did not accurately read his future. A witch also would most likely have not been legally allowed to publicly read the fortunes of Muggles with magic, as such activity would have violated the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy for demonstrating magic in front of Muggles.
