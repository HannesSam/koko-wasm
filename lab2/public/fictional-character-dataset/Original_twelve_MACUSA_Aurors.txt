The original twelve volunteers to train as Aurors for the newly-established Magical Congress of the United States of America after its establishment in 1693 were specially well-regarded in the wizarding history of the United States of America for their small number and the large challenges they faced, a respect which was extended to their descendants.[1]
The original twelve were:
Wilhelm Fischer
Theodard Fontaine
Gondulphus Graves
Robert Grimsditch
Mary Jauncey
Carlos Lopez
Mungo MacDuff
Cormac O'Brien
Abraham Potter
Berthilde Roche
Helmut Weiss
Charity Wilkinson
History
In the late 17th century, the territory that would become the United States of America was one of the most hostile environments for magical people. The continent was teeming with Scourers, an unscrupulous and brutal band of wizarding bounty-hunters and racketeers who hunted their fellow magical beings for personal gain, as well as large numbers of wizarding criminals who had fled to America from Europe and beyond precisely because of the lack of organised law enforcement such as existed in their own countries.[1]
When the situation reached a tipping point in the aftermath of the Salem Witch Trials, the Magical Congress of the United States of America was established in 1693, following the introduction of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, so the wizarding community could build its own underground structures to offer their like mutual support. The top priority of the first wizard elected President of MACUSA by his fellow representatives, Josiah Jackson, was the recruitment and training of Aurors.[1]
The first few volunteers, twelve in total, faced enormous challenges at great personal risk, and because of this they and their descendants earned the enduring respect of the magical community in North America. Of the original twelve Aurors, only two (Charity Wilkinson and Theodard Fontaine) survived into old age.[1]
