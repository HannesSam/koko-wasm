"Ectoplasm is an unpleasant greenish substance left behind by certain ghostly beings. In some places, it will block doorways and openings. You can cast Skurge to get rid of it."
— Filius Flitwick regarding Ectoplasm[src]
Ectoplasm was a sticky, viscous green substance left behind by ghosts and other spirits[1][2] that accumulates over time.[3]

Description
Ectoplasm blocking a door
Ectoplasm was strong enough to act as a powerful adhesive (making a loud churning sound when doing so),[1][2] but it also harmed humans should they come into contact with it, making it a hazard to them. This could prove to be a great annoyance, as it was typically found blocking doorways. Wizards subsequently generally treated ectoplasm as unwanted filth.[1]
History
"In my day we had to take shovels to this stuff, you know."
— Nearly Headless Nick on cleaning ectoplasm[4]
In the Middle Ages, ectoplasm was typically removed by shovelling it elsewhere.[3] Fortunately, some time after 1492, ectoplasm could be cleaned using more convenient methods, such as Mrs Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, or for the more magically inclined, the Skurge Charm.[1]
Behind the scenes
The Toad, a ghost appearing in the earliest drafts for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, left ectoplasm all over its classroom.[5]
The early stages of the making of video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, included plans for an ectoplasm-creating spell.
