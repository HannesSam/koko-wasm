Biography
Early life
Alberic Grunnion was born in 1803,[1] somewhere in the British Isles. If he enrolled at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he attended the school from around 1814 to 1821.
Adulthood
At some point in the nineteenth century, Alberic Grunnion invented the Dungbomb, a prank item that was still very popular among young British wizards by the 1990s.[1]
Death and post-mortem
He died in 1882, at the age of 79. By the early 1990s, he was featured on a Chocolate Frog Card. His card was one of the first in Harry Potter's collection, being among the ones he obtained on his trip to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991.[2]
Etymology
Grunnion's name could possibly be in recognition of Alberich, a powerful wizard from "Song of the Nibelungen." The poem is mythical, but was the basis for Wagner's Ring Cycle. In Wagner's version, Alberich makes a ring from gold that he has found and places a curse on it against its thief. Interestingly, one of the prizes given to a 'hero' of the Ring Cycle is an Invisibility cloak.
