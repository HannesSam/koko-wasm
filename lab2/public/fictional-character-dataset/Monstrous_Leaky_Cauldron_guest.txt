— The Leaky Cauldron maid to the guest[src]
This person or creature (fl. 1993) was a tenant (or belonged to a tenant) at the Leaky Cauldron during the summer of 1993. As the day maid did her rounds, she knocked on the door to the room in which this was accommodated, and the response was a loud roar and the door shut in her face.[1]
