This man led Hogwarts students from Platform 9¾ to the King's Cross Station in the Muggle World. Students were allowed to pass through the barrier in pairs or groups of three. This was intended to ensure that they did not attract too much attention after entering back into the Muggle world through the apparently solid metal ticket barrier.[2]
