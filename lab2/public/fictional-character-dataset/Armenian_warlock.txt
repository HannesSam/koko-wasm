"No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from werewolves. He'd look dreadful on the front cover. No dress sense at all."
— Gilderoy Lockhart[src]
An Armenian warlock was a wizard who saved an entire village from a group of werewolves, including possibly the Wagga Wagga Werewolf. Gilderoy Lockhart took credit for it and wrote a book, titled Wanderings with Werewolves, in which he claimed to have saved the village himself. Lockhart erased this warlock's memory with a Memory Charm to prevent him from "blabbing". Lockhart described him as "ugly" and "old" with "no dress sense".[1]
