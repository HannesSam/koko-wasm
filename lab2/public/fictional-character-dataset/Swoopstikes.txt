Biography
Professor Swoopstikes became the Potions Master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at an unknown point in the school's history. He was also an entomologist, with a vast knowledge of magical insects. Professor Swoopstikes was also a fan of the Tutshill Tornados Quidditch team.[3]
A portrait of Professor Swoopstikes was hung in the Tracery Hall at Hogwarts Castle, depicting him among his vast insect collection, holding a magnifying glass on one hand and a Billywig on the other.
Magical abilities and skills
Potions: As a former Potions Master who taught the subject at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Swoopstikes would have been an expert in the magical art and science of potion-making.
Magizoology: Swoopstikes was also a Magizoologist, with an expansive knowledge of magical insects, meaning he was highly knowledgeable of the study of magical creatures and their habits.
Etymology
To "swoop" is to "move rapidly downward through the air", perhaps an indication towards entomology.[4]
A "stike" is a stanza, and therefore the plural form of stike, "stikes", refers to multiple stanzas.[5]
