The devil is an entity believed in many religions (notably Christianity and Islam) to be the embodiment of evil and the enemy of humankind.[4]
In certain Christian traditions, the devil was said to have once been an angel named Lucifer, cast out of heaven for disobeying God.[5] The story of Lucifer's fall was covered in the book The Hierarchie of the Blessed Angells.[1]
The Fat Lady described Sirius Black as having "eyes like the devil" after he attacked her portrait in 1993.[2]
