This woman was a Muggle and the the mother of Justin Finch-Fletchley.[1]
Biography
She was a Muggle, and was initially a bit disappointed to have her son attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, as before he received his Hogwarts acceptance letter in 1991, he had been registered at Eton College. The following year, Justin made her read Gilderoy Lockhart's books, and she came to appreciate how beneficial it might prove to have a fully-trained wizard in the family.[1]
