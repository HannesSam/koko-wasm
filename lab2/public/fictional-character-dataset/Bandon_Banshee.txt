"I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her."
— Gilderoy Lockhart regarding his supposed banishing of this banshee[src]
The Bandon Banshee was a banshee who was supposedly defeated by Gilderoy Lockhart[1], but it was actually defeated by a witch with a hairy chin.[2] The book Break with a Banshee was most likely centred around this Banshee's defeat.[1]
This achievement seemed to have been one of Lockhart's personal favourites, as he often discussed it, and when Rubeus Hagrid was speaking disdainfully of Lockhart to Harry Potter in 1992, he complained how Lockhart was "bangin’ on about some banshee he banished", when he visited him previously. Hagrid also correctly suspected then that Lockhart was indeed a dishonest con artist, as he stated afterwards that "If one word of it was true, I’ll eat my kettle."[3]
