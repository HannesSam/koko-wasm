Biography
He sold Hagrid the three-headed dog he owned. Hagrid named this dog Fluffy, and, the following year, lent him to Albus Dumbledore, who used him to guard the Philosopher's Stone[1]on the Third-floor corridor.
Behind the scenes
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Hagrid states that he bought Fluffy from "an Irish feller", rather than "a Greek chappie," as he does in the book. This change loses J. K. Rowling's reference to Greek mythology, in which there was a three-head dog, Cerberus, that guarded the gates of Hades. Steve Kloves, the film's screenwriter, stated that he originally used "a Greek chappie," but did not know how the line got changed.[2]
