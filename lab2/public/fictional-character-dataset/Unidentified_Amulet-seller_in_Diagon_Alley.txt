— The street peddler attempts to sell Molly Weasley a supposed protective amulet[src]
This individual was a British wizard who sold Amulets in 1996 in Diagon Alley.[1]
Biography
In 1996, he tried to sell one to Molly Weasley to give to Ginny Weasley, however Arthur Weasley threatened him with arrest.[1] He was one of many preying, in various ways, on the renewed fear which the wizarding populace felt due to the recently acknowledged return of Voldemort and his followers. It is most likely therefore that the supposedly protective amulets he was selling were counterfeit goods which possessed no actual magical properties.
