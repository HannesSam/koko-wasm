Rosemary Ames was a respected British Muggle horticulturalist. She lived in Devon, England, where she kept a personal garden, which she described as "[her own] Elysian Fields." In 1997, she allowed Hadrian's Wall, a British horticulture magazine, to tour her garden. The magazine published an article about the garden, proclaiming it "Devon heaven," and comparing it to Eden.[1]
