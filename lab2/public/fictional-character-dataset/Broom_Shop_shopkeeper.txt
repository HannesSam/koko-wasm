Shopkeeper: "Hello, young man. Are you a first year student?"
Harry Potter: "I will be soon."
Shopkeeper: "You know I can't sell to you, of course. But look around all you like."
— This man speaks with Harry Potter in 1991.[src]
This individual was a British wizard who owned the Broom Shop in Diagon Alley by 1991.
He was a blond man with blue eyes and a moustache, and often wore blue robes. He was a polite man, as he would let first year students browse around his shop, even though he refused to sell them anything, as broomsticks are contraband for first years at Hogwarts.[1]
