Grenouille: "I cannot go with you to the market today, Crapaud."
Crapaud: "But Grenouille, I cannot carry the cow alone."
Grenouille: "You know, Crapaud, that I am to be Keeper this morning. Who will stop the Quaffle if I do not?"
— Extract from Hélas, Je me suis Transfiguré Les Pieds[src]
Crapaud is a character in the 15th century play Hélas, Je me suis Transfiguré Les Pieds by the French writer, Malecrit. In the play, Crapaud asks Grenouille for help to carry a cow to the market, but Grenouille has to refuse since he is due to play Keeper for his local Quidditch team.[1] The play's main conflict occurs when Crapaud performs the titular foot-transfiguration, an act traditionally accompanied by a puff of yellow smoke (which is conjured by a special effects wizard concealed beneath the stage).[2]
The play concludes with Crapaud's final rousing monologue.[2]
