"The front hall also boasts statues of the one-eyed Witch and the Architect of Hogwarts."
— Description[src]
This individual (fl. circa 993) was a wizard who lived during the Middle Ages and planned, designed and oversaw the construction of buildings of Hogwarts Castle,[2] along with Founder Rowena Ravenclaw, who devised the ever-changing floorplan.
There was a golden statue of this individual at Hogwarts Entrance Hall, in which he was shown among the four house mascots holding a model of Hogwarts on one of his hands, and charts and a set square in the other.[3] The statue guarded a hidden passageway to the Founders' Tower.
Behind the scenes
In the PS1 version of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the statue of the Architect hides a passageway to the Founder Duels and the Founders' Tower.
