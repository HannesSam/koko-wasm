Biography
Mrs Boot was born in Scotland sometime in the 17th century. She was likely educated at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[1]
She eventually landed an unspecified job with the Ministry of Magic. When Webster Boot, as an Auror for hire, travelled to London to repatriate a fugitive British dark wizard, they both fell in love. Webster then relocated to Britain to be with her. Their descendants, likely including Terry Boot, would go on to be educated at Hogwarts.[1]
