"As expected, "Edward Scot" transformed back into Gareth Greengrass as soon as his Polyjuice Potion wore off. I've done some digging since then. As it turns out, there is no wizard named Edward Scot. He's actually a persona Gareth created using Muggle Kensington Millbottom's appearance."
— Harry Potter[src]
Kensington Millbottom was a Muggle whose appearance was stolen by Gareth Greengrass using Polyjuice Potion in order to take on the persona of 'Edward Scot'.[2]
Biography
By 2015,[3] Gareth Greengrass stole Kensington's appearance using Polyjuice Potion in order to deceive the Ministry of Magic. He invented the persona of 'Edward Scot', and became the Lead Liaison Minister of the Department of International Magical Co-operation.[2]
Gareth was secretly a member of The Unforgivable. In 2021, Harry Potter was investigating Gareth when he persuaded a naïve well-wisher to help him escape. Harry found out through Hermione Granger that a bottle of Polyjuice Potion had been taken. Gareth had taken Kensington's appearance again in order to run away unnoticed, but Harry saw 'Edward' leaving in a hurry and stopped him, finding out the truth when the effect of the Polyjuice Potion faded.[2]
It is not known what became of the real Kensington.
