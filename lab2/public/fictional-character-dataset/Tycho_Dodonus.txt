"A son cruelly banished
Despair of the daughter
Return, great avenger
With wings from the water."
— A prophecy from The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus[src]
Tycho Dodonus was a wizard of unknown nationality and an accomplished Seer, who prophesied in verse.[2] At some point, many, if not all of Dodonus's prophecies were compiled in a book called The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus.[2]
Apparently, Tycho Dodonus's prophecies were not universally accepted; Porpentina Goldstein dismissed his work as nothing more than poetry, a notion that Yusuf Kama did not seem to challenge,[2] even though he evidently was a firm believer in the prophecies nonetheless.[3]

Etymology
"Tycho" is derived from the Greek "Τυχων" meaning "hitting the mark". It is also derived from "Tyche", the Greek goddess of luck.
"Dodonus" is derived from "Dodona", a location in Greece that was the seat of one of Zeus' oracles.
Behind the scenes
Tycho Dodonus may be reference to Nostradamus, a 16th-century French physician and reputed seer who published Les Propheties, a collection of quatrains that, allegedly, accurately predicted many major world events.
The name Tycho may be taken from the Danish astronomer, Tycho Brahe, who in his lifetime also had been a astrologer. Brahe had once made out a horoscope for King Frederick II of Denmark's son, the future King Christian IV.
