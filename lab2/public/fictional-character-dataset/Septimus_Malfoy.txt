Etymology
Septimus is a Latin word for "seventh." This naming may be an attempt to draw reference to the powerful magical properties of the number seven.
Behind the scenes
In 1992, Harry Potter, speaking about Draco Malfoy, said, "Look at his family... The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin, he's always boasting about it".[3] This indicates that Septimus was most likely a Slytherin if he attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, though it cannot be confirmed.
In 1997 a portrait was hung in Malfoy Manor showing a wizard; Septimus may be that wizard.
Oddly, Septimus is a name that also appears on the Weasley family tree, an almost rival family of the Malfoys in later years.
The relationship between Septimus and Unctuous Osbert is similar to that of his descendent Lucius Malfoy and Cornelius Fudge.

Notes and references
↑ These are the latest years that Septimus could have been born, which would make him 17 at some point during the ministerial term(s) of Unctuous Osbert (1789 - 1798). Presumably, however, Septimus was not as young as seventeen when he was advisor and was older.
