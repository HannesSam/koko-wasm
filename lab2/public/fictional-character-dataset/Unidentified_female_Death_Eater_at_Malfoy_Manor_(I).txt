In late July 1997, This Death Eater present at the meeting at Malfoy Manor. During the meeting she sat next to Thorfinn Rowle, during which Voldemort discussed his plan to attempt to kill Harry Potter. She later witnessed Lord Voldemort murder his airborne hostage Charity Burbage, with her corpse being then fed to his pet snake Nagini.[1]
It is unknown whether she participated in the Battle of Hogwarts as she was not seen though she most likely was present, assuming that she survived up to that point. Following Voldemort's defeat and death she was presumably killed, sent to Azkaban, or fled from the battle.
