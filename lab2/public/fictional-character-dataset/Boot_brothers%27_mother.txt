Mrs Boot (d. mid-1620s to early 1630s) was an Irish witch who travelled to the New World with the Plymouth settlement in the 17th century. She was the mother of Chadwick and Webster Boot, two founders of Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[1]
Biography
Mrs Boot and her husband were originally from Ireland. In the 1620s, they decided to move to the New World with their young sons, Chadwick and Webster, in search of an adventure. They travelled with the Plymouth settlement, befriending James Steward, an English Muggle, on their journey across the Atlantic Ocean.[1]
However, when the family left the settlement to venture into the nearby woods for their adventure, they were attacked by a Hidebehind. Mrs Boot and her husband were killed, but their sons were saved by Isolt Sayre and William the Pukwudgie, and subsequently nursed back to health.[1]
Isolt returned to the site of the attack a two weeks later, intending to give the brothers' parents a decent burial, only to find James Steward in the process of digging graves. James had become concerned when his friends went missing, and thus went looking for them in the woods.[1]
Mrs Boot's sons were adopted by Isolt and James. Isolt took her wand, which had a unicorn tail hair core, along with her husband's wand. However, both wands were broken and their cores eventually died, meaning they could not be passed on to the couple's sons. Nonetheless, Isolt was able to study the couple's wands, and this helped her to craft new wands for her adopted sons.[1]
Mrs Boot's sons would go on to help found Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Through her son Chadwick, she become an ancestor of Calderon-Boot family, and through her son Webster, an ancestor of later British Boots (including Terry Boot).[1]
