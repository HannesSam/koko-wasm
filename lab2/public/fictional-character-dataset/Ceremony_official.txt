History
In the summer of 1997, he presided over the funeral of Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry[2] and at the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour at the Burrow.[1] Given his occupation, he may be an employee of the Ministry of Magic.
Behind the scenes
The uncredited role of "Wizard Priest"[3] was played by Mick Fryer-Kelsey in the first part of the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. In his Twitter profile, Fryer-Kelsey clarified that he played the man that appears in "the wedding picture of Luna and her father" that featured in an old revision of the Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour article here at the Harry Potter Wiki.[4][5]
