History
Origins
Eventually, three of these Muggles became employed as a guard, guitarist, and officer respectively, while the others pursued unknown careers.[3]
Destroyed by Peter Pettigrew
After betraying the Potters, Pettigrew was pursued by Sirius Black, and was eventually cornered by him on a crowded London[1] street. Pettigrew then loudly accused Black of betraying the Potters, cast an extremely powerful explosive curse (likely the Blasting Curse), and escaped, leaving behind a finger he had cut off to fake his death. This explosion claimed the lives of twelve Muggles, and left a deep crater in the street. Over fifty Muggle witnesses reported what Pettigrew said to Ministry of Magic officials. Black was imprisoned in Azkaban without trial. Before his capture, Black was found laughing like a maniac, seemingly confirming his guilt.[2]
Pettigrew blows up half the street
The Ministry of Magic had difficulty covering up this event given the extent of the damage and the number of Muggle casualties.[2] They erased the memories of surviving Muggle witnesses[4] and disseminated the story that the explosion had been caused by a leak in a gas main.[2]
Legacy
It was not until 1994 that Remus Lupin realised Black was innocent and convinced Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger to believe the truth.[5] Nevertheless, Cornelius Fudge ignored their stories,[6] and the Ministry continued to consider Black guilty until after his murder in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries on 18 June, 1996.[7]
