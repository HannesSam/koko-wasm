1379 duelling contest
[Source]
This individual was a wizard who, in 1379, partook in an international duelling contest on Dartmoor.[1]
The duelling was noted, by witnesses, to have been of a standard that few had ever seen before. As the contest progressed, only four contestants remained: this wizard, three more wizards, and an English witch, Elizabeth Smudgling.[1]
The first semi-finalist faces the second semi-finalist
This wizard was the first semi-finalist, and was to take part in the first duel. Keeping in mind the judges' advice to "think big", he transformed himself into a bull and charged the second wizard, who escaped death by quickly turning himself into a viper. The second wizard bit the first on the leg, sending him crashing to the ground in pain.[1]
Considering that in the Middle Ages, before there was a Ministry of Magic to regulate such matters, duelling was usually fatal,[2] and given his particularly violent defeat, it is likely this individual died.
