Biography
Bethany made a sketch of a witch that provided a clue for Mathilda Grimblehawk and her partner investigating the magical beast attack at the construction site.
Soon after, Bethany went missing, although the flowers in her toybox provided further clues as to her possible whereabouts. Her fairy necklace was later found in Winifred Whittle's cottage and she was ultimately escorted out of the forest by Magnus, a centaur.[1]
Her memory was later Obliviated.[2]
