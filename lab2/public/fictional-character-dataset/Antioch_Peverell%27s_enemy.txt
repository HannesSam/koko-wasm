"The first brother travelled on for a week or more, and reaching a distant village, he sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally, with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible."
— Beedle the Bard, The Tale of the Three Brothers[src]
This man (fl. 13th century) was a wizard with whom Antioch Peverell had a quarrel.[1]
Antioch killing this wizard in a duel
When Antioch obtained his unbeatable wand, he killed this wizard in a duel and later went into an inn, where he boasted about his powerful wand. Peverell, while sleeping "wine-sodden", had his wand stolen and his throat slit by a thief.[1]
