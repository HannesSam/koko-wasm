"Everyone was worried about Penelope Padgett. It wasn't because she was from Slytherin, mind you. Her parents were open supporters of You-Know-Who… Her mum's in Azkaban. There was some reason for a bit of caution."
— Ronald Weasley regarding the negative reputation of this family in the wizarding world[src]
The Padgett family were a British wizarding family of unknown blood status.[2]
History
During the Second Wizarding War, Mrs Padgett and her husband were passionate supporters of Lord Voldemort, something which landed Mrs Padgett in Azkaban for after the war ended and Voldemort was defeated and killed. Their daughter Penelope, was gifted a Comet 290 broomstick by her mother before she was sent to Azkaban prison.[2]
Penelope started attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s and became a member of Slytherin house. She was an academically successful student, with her becoming a prefect in her fifth year. After graduating from Hogwarts, she applied to become an Auror for the British Ministry of Magic. However, many individuals in the Ministry were very suspicious of her, due to her parent's association with Voldemort and the Death Eaters, such as Gethsemane Prickle. However, Penelope succeeded in becoming an Auror and became friends with Harry Potter, the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Penelope also married Grim Fawley, an Unspeakable in the Department of Mysteries, and the couple had at least two children together, Addison and Melody Fawley.[2]
At some point in the 21st century, Penelope mysteriously disappeared, and her husband Grim was accused of having cast the Foundables Spell, which caused the Calamity to happen.[2]
