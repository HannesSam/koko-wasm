Biography
During a Cuaditch game in 1269, Chief Bragge released a Golden Snidget onto the field, and offered the player who captured it one-hundred and fifty Galleons. In protest, Modesty Rabnott summoned the Snidget to her and fled the game. After she was caught, Bragge had to be calmed down by his advisers to prevent him to turn Modesty into a horned toad, or worse. Rabnott was only then fined ten Galleons.[1]
