Jesus, also known as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was the central figure of Christianity, regarded by most Christian denominations as the son of God, born of a human mother, Mary.[1] He was considered an important prophet in Islam.[1]
There was a stained glass window in the St Jerome's Church in Godric's Hollow which depicted Jesus along with the authors of the four books of the Gospel (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John).[2]
One of the known works by artist Haniball Carathi was a "little piece" depicting "our Ladie" (i.e., Mary) with the presumably infant Jesus "upon her right hand."[3] A catalogue listing for this work was incorporated into the label of the Belch Powder box.[3]
Behind the scenes
Jesus has been portrayed by some Harry Potter actors:
John Hurt, who played Garrick Ollivander, played Jesus in History of the World, Part I.
Ralph Fiennes, who played Lord Voldemort, provided the voice of Jesus in The Miracle Maker.
