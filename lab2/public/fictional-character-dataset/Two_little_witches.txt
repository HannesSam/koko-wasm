The two little witches were toddler-age sisters who attended the 1994 Quidditch World Cup with their parents.[1]
Biography
During the 1994 Quidditch World Cup, Harry Potter spotted them. They looked a little older than Kevin, who was about two, and were both flying around on toy broomsticks that rose only about two feet off the ground. A Ministry of Magic official caught sight of them and went to warn their parents — who he assumed were still in bed — against letting children display magical abilities in plain view. It is also possible that the girls' parents were simply unaware of the presence of Muggles nearby.[1]
