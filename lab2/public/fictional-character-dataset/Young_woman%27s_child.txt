"My baby is grievously ill. Won't you please help us? Your father bade me come if troubled –"
— The young woman to the Wizard[src]
The young woman's child was a character in the tale The Wizard and the Hopping Pot by Beedle the Bard. The child was very ill, and when its mother asked the Wizard for help, he slammed the door on her. Later, when the Wizard could bear no more of his father's lucky cooking pot, he doused the baby in Dittany and it woke "well and rosy".[1]
