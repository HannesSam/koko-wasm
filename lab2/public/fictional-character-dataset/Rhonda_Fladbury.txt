Biography
Her name was seen on the Marauder's Map in the 1993–1994 school year.[4] She was a member of the Duelling Club run by Helen Dawlish in the Middle Courtyard during the 1996–1997 school year.[3]
Etymology
The name "Rhonda" was probably intended to mean "good spear" from Welsh rhon "spear" and da "good", but possibly influenced by the name of the Rhondda Valley in South Wales, which means "noisy". It has been in use only since the 20th century.

This particular student was only featured in the console versions of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Nintendo DS version of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.
