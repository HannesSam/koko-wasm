Biography
Catherine Tyler was a Muggle, who fell in love with a wizard, Horatio Cloke. They once planned to elope, and Horatio stashed away a chest full of gold and jewels to take when they did. Catherine had half a key to open the chest.[1] However, they didn't elope and when Horatio died, he turned into a ghost who haunted Cloke Mansion.[2]
Catherine went on to gain a granddaughter, Megan Scott. She later gave her the key to chest and a map of the area, and told her to 'seek her past' and that 'Cloke knows the truth'. Catherine soon died, and her granddaughter pursued seeking what her grandmother told her to.[2] Mathilda Grimblehawk and her partner had to help Megan when she was attacked by Jacturus Cloke III, and they found and gave her the chest.[1]
Behind the scenes
Despite being a Muggle, Catherine seemingly had the ability to see her lover Horatio Cloke's ghost; Pottermore states that Muggles lack the ability to properly visualise ghosts, unlike wizards.
