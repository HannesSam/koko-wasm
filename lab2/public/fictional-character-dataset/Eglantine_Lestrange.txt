Etymology
Eglantine's name originates from Old French and it means "spiny, needle-like", which is in reference to the thorns of the eglantine, which is a wild rose also known as sweet briar.
Behind the scenes
Unlike all other spouses included in the family tree (Heloise Beaufort, Minette Rosier, Laurena Kama, and Clarisse Tremblay), Eglantine is depicted with the Lestrange surname. This might signify a case of inbreeding, since this was reported as a practise of the Lestrange family.[3]
A family tree released later reveals that Eglantine and Corvus (III) were first cousins, as their fathers (Falco and Corvus (II), respectively) were brothers.[1]
Appearances
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (Name appears on family tree)

Rowling: "The Malfoy Family" at Wizarding World - "The family has, however, eschewed the somewhat dangerous practise of inter-marrying within such a small pool of pure-bloods that they become enfeebled or unstable, unlike a small minority of fanatic families such as the Gaunts and Lestranges"
