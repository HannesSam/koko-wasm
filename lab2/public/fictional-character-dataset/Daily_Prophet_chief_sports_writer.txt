"[…] a Beater who is unable to fly defends three sticks instead of a hoop, while a Snitch without wings is thrown at the sticks. That's it. Sometimes for several days."
— Daily Prophet article, 1902.[src]
This individual worked in the capacity of chief sports writer for the Daily Prophet in the early 20th century. In response to the wizarding world's crescent interest in Muggle rugby due to the popularity of Squib player Angus Buchanan, this individual wrote an article about cricket (which Buchanan was also adept at) — cricket did not have the appeal to wizards that rugby had, and he described it as a very inferior form of Quidditch.[1]
