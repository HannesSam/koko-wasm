Wee Willykins was a character in Beatrix Bloxam's heavily-reworked version of the Beedle the Bard tale The Wizard and the Hopping Pot. In the story, Wee Willykins cured his dolls' stomachaches after initially being "an old grumpy-wumpkins" and refusing to do so, causing the golden hopping pot to dance delightedly on "its tiny rosy toes" and fill with sweets for Wee Willykins and the dolls.[1]
