Edmund Grubb was a ghost at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
He lived in the Victorian era, and died in the doorway of the Great Hall at Hogwarts Castle after ingesting poisonous berries. After his death, he returned as a ghost to haunt the Castle, sometimes stopping people from getting into the Great Hall out of spite.
Behind the scenes
Edmund Grubb was one of the original ghosts created by J. K. Rowling but did not survive final edits. She "rather regrets" not using his character.[1]
