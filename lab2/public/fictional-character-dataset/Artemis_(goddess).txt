Artemis was the Greek goddess of the hunt and the Moon. The scientific name for wormwood, Artemisia absinthium, is derived from the name of Artemis.[1]
Behind the scenes
Despite originally being a female name, Artemis is one of the middle names of Newton Scamander, author of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as well as Artemisia Lufkin whose first name Artemisia is a feminine form of Artemisios, a Greek name which derived from Artemis. Newt shares this trait with Artemis Fowl, the protagonist of a popular fantasy book series sometimes compared to the Harry Potter franchise. However, it is unlikely that a reference was intended; rather, it seems likely that Newt was named after a goddess associated with nature because of his own ties to the animal kingdom.
