"Morning, Albert. Dirk Cresswell, eh? From Goblin Liaison? Nice one, Albert. I'm pretty confident I'll get his job now!"
— This wizard to "Albert Runcorn" (actually Harry Potter in disguise) during the Infiltration of the Ministry of Magic.[src]
This man was a wizard, who was an employee at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures in the late-1990s. On 2 September, 1997, after Albert Runcorn tracked down the wizard who faked Dirk Cresswell's family tree and Cresswell was sent to Azkaban, this wizard congratulated who he believed to be Runcorn (but was actually Harry Potter in disguise) as he was confident he would take Cresswell's job at the Goblin Liaison Office with him out of the picture.[1]
