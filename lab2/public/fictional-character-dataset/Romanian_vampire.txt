"His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days."
— Description of Quirinus Quirrell's D.A.D.A. classes.[src]
An alleged vampire in Romania was speculated by many of Professor Quirinus Quirrell's students in the 1991–1992 school year to be the reason for the strange smell of garlic that lingered in his classroom.[1] Even Rubeus Hagrid believed that a meeting with vampires in the Black Forest may have contributed to Quirrell's nervious behaviour and stuttering.[2]
