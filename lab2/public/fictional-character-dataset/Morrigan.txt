Morrigan was a famous Irish pure-blood witch, notable for being an Animagus who could turn into a crow.[1] It is unknown whether or not she was a registered Animagus.
Morrigan was an ancestor of William Sayre, who nicknamed his daughter, Isolt, "Morrigan" due to her affinity for all things natural when she was young.[1]

Magical skills and abilities
Transfiguration: Morrigan was exceptionally proficient with the art of Human Transfiguration, that she learned how to become an Animagus, allowing her to transform into a crow at will.[1]
Potions: In order to fully became an Animagus, one must brew the highly advanced, difficult and time-consuming Animagus potion to complete the process,[3] meaning she was very talented in this magical field as well.
Etymology
According to Irish mythology, the Morrígan ("phantom queen") or Mórrígan (moe-ree-gan) ("great queen") was a figure associated with fate, especially with foretelling doom and death in battle — in this capacity, she would take the shape of a crow, flying above the battlefield.[4]
