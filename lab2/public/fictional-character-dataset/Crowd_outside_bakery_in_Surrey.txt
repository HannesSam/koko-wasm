— This crowd deep in discussion[src]
This crowd of wizards and witches was convened near the entrance to a bakery in Surrey on 1 November, 1981 when Vernon Dursley was passing through. He overheard snatches of their conversation and realised they were discussing the Potter family. He was disturbed by this fact, as he generally pretended his wife's relatives didn't exist.[1]
