The esteemed Seer Cassandra Vablatsky
"True Seers are very rare, and Professor Trelawney..."

Description
Seers predicted prophecies, which were then recorded and stored in the Hall of Prophecy in the Ministry of Magic's Department of Mysteries.[2][3]
According to Minerva McGonagall, true Seers were extremely rare, and she had doubt that Sybill Trelawney could be considered as one despite her sporadically accurate predictions.[1][4]
Albus Dumbledore once told Harry Potter that seeing into the future was incredibly difficult because of the complexity of every single action and their consequences.[5]
Centaurs were Seers with their own brand of Divination, which differs from that of humans.[6]
