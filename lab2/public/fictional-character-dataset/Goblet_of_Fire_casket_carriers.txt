This was a group of four wizards that worked for the Ministry of Magic. In 1994 they delivered the Goblet of Fire to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the Triwizard Tournament, and were overseen by Argus Filch, Hogwarts Caretaker.[1]
Behind the scenes
"The casket, then, if you please, Mr Filch."
— Albus Dumbledore asks Argus Filch alone to bring the casket.[src]
In the fourth novel, the Goblet of Fire casket is small enough for a man to carry, so Argus Filch carries it by himself.[2] As the film version contradicts the literary canon, these men are non-canon.
