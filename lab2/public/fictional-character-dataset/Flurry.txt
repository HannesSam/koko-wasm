Flurry was an imaginary friend that Scorpius Malfoy invented to keep himself company as a child.[1] His friendship with Flurry reportedly ended when they had a disagreement over the correct rules of Gobstones.[1] Scorpius recounted this story to Delphi many years later when she discussed her own lonely childhood.[1]
