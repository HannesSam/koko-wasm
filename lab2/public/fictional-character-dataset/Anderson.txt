Biography
In 1977, they followed a motorbike that was speeding through the streets of an unnamed city and finally cornered it in a dead-end alley. As the two attempted to arrest the pair of youths on the bike — who identified themselves as Sirius Black and James Potter — they witnessed an attack on the pair by three men flying on broomsticks.[1]
