This Ministry of Magic wizard was an employee of the British Ministry of Magic. In 1994, he was working at the Quidditch World Cup, helping to keep up security to prevent drawing attention from Muggles. He was seen attempting to persuade a wizard named Archie Aymslowe to change out of his flowery nightgown and into a pair of trousers.[1]
