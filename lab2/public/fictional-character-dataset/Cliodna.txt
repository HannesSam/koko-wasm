Biography
An Animagus with the ability to turn into a sea bird, she was aided by three magical birds that cured the sick by singing them to sleep. It was also said that she could turn into a wave. She also discovered the properties of Moondew. Cliodne appeared on a Chocolate Frog Card.[1][2][3]
In September of 1991, Harry Potter picked up a Chocolate Frog Card with a picture of Cliodna, who was scratching her nose.[4]
Magical abilities and skills
Potions: Cliodna was highly proficient with potions, as she discovered a new ingredient, Moondew and its properties in potion-making. Furthermore, she would have needed to have brewed the Animagus potion in order for her to gain the ability to fully transform, a potion known for being highly difficult, complex and time-consuming, showing her very impressive talent in the art of potion-making.
Transfiguration: She was also a mistress of transfiguration, being able to turn herself into a sea bird at will. Given how Human Transfiguration is an incredibly complex and even dangerous branch of transfiguration, this was a remarkable magical feat.
Behind the scenes
In Irish mythology, Cliodna was a goddess of love and beauty, said to have three brightly coloured birds whose song healed the sick. She left Tir Tairngire to be with her mortal lover, Ciabhán, but drowned as she slept in Glandore harbour in County Cork.
She was also rumoured to be the "Queen of the Banshees".
