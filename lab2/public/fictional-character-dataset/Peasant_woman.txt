Peasant woman: "My granddaughter is afflicted by a crop of warts, sir. Your father used to mix a special poultice in that old cooking pot –"
Wizard: "Begone! What care I for your brat's warts?"
— The peasant woman and the Wizard[src]
The peasant woman was a character in the tale The Wizard and the Hopping Pot by Beedle the Bard. She was described as "old" and had a granddaughter afflicted by a crop of warts. A kindly old wizard used to make a special poultice for her but when he died, his son rudely refused to give her the potion.[1]
