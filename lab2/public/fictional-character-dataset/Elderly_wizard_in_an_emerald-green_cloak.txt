This wizard was among the crowds celebrating the fall of Lord Voldemort in 1981 by wearing wizarding attire among Muggles. In particular, he was wearing an emerald-green cloak. Vernon Dursley saw this wizard on his drive to work on 1 November, and considered how ridiculous it was for a man even older than him to be dressed like that.[1]
