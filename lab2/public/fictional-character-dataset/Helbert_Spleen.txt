Biography
In one issue, Spleen replied to a letter from Howland Coopey, diagnosing him with Dragon Pox based on the symptoms he described.[2]
During the Calamity, a Calamity Investigator had a meal with Spleen, who showed them several ways to modify the harvesting, handling and incorporation of Dittany.[3]
Magical abilities and skills
Healing magic: Spleen was a professional Healer, meaning he was very accomplished with medical magic, such as with healing spells, potions and other magical remedies.[2]
Herbology: Spleen was also skilled with handling and using magical medicinal plants, such as Dittany, to which he showed a Calamity Investigator how to best harvest, handle and utilise the said plant.[3]
Behind the scenes
The Daily Prophet referred to Spleen by the title "Professor." This may indicate that he once taught at a wizarding school. This can be, however, just an academic title.[2]
