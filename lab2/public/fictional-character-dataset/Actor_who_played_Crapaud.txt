"Take one ill-fated performance of Malecrit's classic wizarding play 'Alas, I have Transfigured my Feet'. History does not record the names of the actors, which is perhaps for the best since by halfway throught the first act the audience had taken to throwing pumpkins."
— Miranda Goshawk, Book of Spells.[src]
This individual was a wizard and actor who played the part of Crapaud in a disastrous performance of Malecrit's classic wizarding play Hélas, Je me suis Transfiguré Les Pieds.
Biography
The names of the actors of this particular performance were not recorded and, as such, are unknown to history.[1]
This individual's performance, alongside the performance of the wizard who played Grenouille, was not particularly appealing and, as such, the bored audience spent much of act one throwing pumpkins at them.[1]
During the eponymous foot-transfiguration scene, the special effects wizard tried to liven up the play by conjuring a stream of flames instead of the puff of yellow smoke he was supposed to conjure. The curtains caught alight and soon enough the whole theatre was ablaze. The actor playing Crapaud took this as his moment to shine and, protected by a Flame-Freezing Charm, delivered the play's final rousing speech in the flame-engulfed stage, as the rest of the cast and the audience fled in panic, and the special effects wizard vainly trying to put out the fire while dodging hexes from the play's director.[1]
