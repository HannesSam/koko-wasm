"While there have been no proven referee slayings since [1357], there have been several incidences of broom-tampering over the centuries, the most dangerous being the transformation of the referee's broom into a Portkey, so that he or she is whisked away from the match halfway through and turns up months later in the Sahara Desert."
— Kennilworthy Whisp, Quidditch Through the Ages.[src]
This wizard was a Quidditch referee sometime between 1357 and the 1990s. During one of the matches he refereed, he found himself transported to the Sahara Desert, as someone from the crowd of spectators transformed his broomstick into a Portkey.[1]
