Biography
A younger Rastrick during one of his dance routines
Born in 1750, Xavier Rastrick became a performer in the early nineteenth century. By the 1830s, his exuberant personality attracted a relatively large audience to his shows.
In 1836, a crowd of three hundred witches and wizards gathered in the village of Painswick to watch one of his performances. The show, however, became infamous, as Rastrick unexpectedly vanished halfway through a tap-dance routine and was never seen or heard from again. He was subsequently declared dead, with his true fate unknown.
By the 1990s, Rastrick was featured on a Chocolate Frog Card for his mysterious disappearance.[1]
Behind the scenes
The reason why Rastrick suddenly disappeared is completely unknown, let alone whether or not he truly vanished into non-being. It might have been a case of vanishing sickness. Alternatively, Rastrick might have become un-born due to some time-travelling mishap (as his disappearance was before 1899, when the Ministry stopped conducting time-travelling experiments).
Based on the fact that his sudden and unexpected disappearance is similar to the recurring disappearances of Quidditch referees, a similar situation may have happened, where an object in contact with Rastrick, such as his hat, was transformed into a Portkey, whisking him away from the stage to somewhere else where he may have died or turned up far into the future.
Etymology
The name "Xavier" is derived from the Basque place name Etxaberri meaning "the new house". This was the surname of the Jesuit priest Saint Francis Xavier (1506—1552). He was a missionary to India, Japan, China, and other areas in eastern Asia, and he is the patron saint of the Orient and missionaries. His surname has since been adopted as a given name in his honour, chiefly among Catholics.
