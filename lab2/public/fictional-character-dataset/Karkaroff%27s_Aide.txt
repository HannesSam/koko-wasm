Biography
Early Life
He was born sometime before 1976, presumably somewhere in Europe.[4] He attended Durmstrang Institute sometime during the 1980s. He graduated sometime before 1994 and later became Igor Karkaroff's aide.[2][3]
Triwizard Tournament
In October 1994, he travelled with his school to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where his school was to compete in the Triwizard Tournament.[2] Unlike the other students, he didn't put his name in the Goblet of Fire as he was a past student.[3]
At the Yule Ball, he went with a Beauxbatons girl. They danced together during the ball and watched the Weird Sisters play.[2]
He sat between Viktor Krum and Parvati Patil when Albus Dumbledore informed the students about the cause of the death of Cedric Diggory in the Great Hall at Hogwarts. He later returned to Durmstrang with Igor and the other students at the end of the school year.[2]
Physical appearance
He had oily jet black hair, hazel eyes, a hooked nose, high cheekbones, a moustache, and facial hair on his chin and jawline.[2]
Behind the scenes
Karkaroff's Aide: "May I have your arm?"
Parvati Patil: "Arm, leg, I'm yours."
— Karkaroff's Aide asking Parvati Patil for a dance at the Yule Ball[src]
Karkaroff's Aide was portrayed by Tolga Safer in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Tolga Safer auditioned for the role of Viktor Krum but did not get the part, mainly because he did not look like the character. Mike Newell, the director, was so impressed with Tolga's acting that he made the role of Karkaroff's Aide especially for him.[3]
In the film, this individual asks Parvati Patil to dance with him during the Yule Ball, after Harry Potter rejects her. However in the book, Parvati is instead asked to dance by a boy from Beauxbatons, which she does eagerly.
At least on occasion during filming, Tolga hung out with Stanislav Ianevski, doing card tricks among other means of killing time. This can be seen on the bonus DVD for the film.
In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, this character may have been made more generic, being simply called "Durmstrang Student".
It is possible that this individual is Poliakoff. However, this individual is trusted by Karkaroff, whereas Poliakoff is regarded by him as a "disgusting child",[5] so this in highly unlikely.
