Biography
An accomplished witch, Levina Monkstanley was the one who first developed the Wand-Lighting Charm, Lumos, and the Wand-Extinguishing Charm, Nox. She astonished her colleagues one day by lighting the tip of her wand to look for a dropped quill in a dusty corner.[1]
Magical abilities and skills
Spell creation: Levina accomplished the immensely complex and difficult magical art of inventing new spells, as she was the inventor of the highly useful and practical Wand-Lighting Charm, along with the Wand-Extinguishing Charm, its Counter-charm.[1]
Charms: Levinia was very skilled with charms, given how she invented the Wand-Lighting Charm and Wand-Extinguishing Charm in her lifetime, and put them both to great use in her career at the Department of Mysteries.[1]
Etymology
Levina is of uncertain origin. It may derive from the Russian for lion (lev), the Latin name "Lavinia," or the word "levin," an archaic term for a lightning bolt.
Monkstanley appears to be a combination of the two real-world surnames Monk, an occupational surname which ultimately descends from the Greek for "solitary," and Stanley, which is of English origin and means "the stony meadow."
