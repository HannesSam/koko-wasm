Biography
She is best known as the subject of one of Leonardo Da Vinci's portraits. She used to arrange meetings in which Milanese intellectuals discussed philosophy and other subjects, and Cecilia herself presided over these discussions.
By the 1990s, there was a portrait of Gallerani hung at Hogwarts Castle, on the stairway leading to the Dungeons.[1]
Behind the scenes
Cecilia Gallerani's portrait can be seen during the end credits of the PS1 video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, representing one of the designers of the game Anna Larke.
