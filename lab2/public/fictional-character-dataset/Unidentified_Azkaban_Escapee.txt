History
This prisoner's Azkaban number plate
He was known to have escaped during one of the Death Eater-led raids at the height of Voldemort’s reign, but otherwise, he was historically inconsequential.[1]
In October 2019, however, the Calamity chose to focus on him. As Constance Pickering found out, the number of the prisoner, also captured by the Calamity, belonged to this individual.[1]
Behind the scenes
It is possible that he is Gareth Greengrass' brother.
