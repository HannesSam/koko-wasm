Biography
In the winter period of 2020-2021, during the Calamity, he became witness to multiple Foundable traces and reported them online in a serious breach of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy. This was in spite of Statute of Secrecy Task Force members taking all precautions against discovery. When caught with a Triwizard golden egg Foundable, he attempted to run away with his evidence, but was caught and obliviated. Brice seemed to have foreknowledge regarding the wizarding world and knew that he would be stopped and obliviated, raising concerns that he had been aided by The Unforgivable, a secret cabal of apparent Dark Wizards who appeared to manipulate the Calamity for their own gain.[1]
