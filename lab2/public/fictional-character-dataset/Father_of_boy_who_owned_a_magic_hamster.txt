"Saving on the light bill by using Lumos helped mum and dad save enough Galleons to send me here."
— His son shortly before Quirinus Quirrell's Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson concerning the Wand-Lighting Charm.[src]
This individual was a wizard who lived in the British Isles. He later got married to a witch and in c. 1980 he had a son. They were presumably very poor as they saved on the light bill by using the Wand-Lighting Charm, Lumos, to save Galleons to be able to afford their son's trip to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[1]
