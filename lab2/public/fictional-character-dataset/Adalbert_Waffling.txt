"Tamper with the deepest mysteries ― the source of life, the essence of self ― only if prepared for consequences of the most extreme and dangerous kind."
— Waffling's first Fundamental Law of Magic[src]
Adalbert Waffling (d. 1981)[1] was a British wizard who was a magical theoretician, credited to have written "all about magic". Waffling is somewhat seen as the "father of magical theory", as it is a popular claim that every modern witch or wizard has learned from his writings.
Waffling was the one who formulated the Fundamental Laws of Magic[3] and wrote Magical Theory, a most popular textbook still being used today by the young witches and wizards at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[2]

Biography
Early life
Adalbert Waffling was born in or before the 19th-century. By the 1890s, he was already a most notable theoretician.[4] Waffling might have attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in his youth, like so many other wizards before him.
Later life
Waffling studying magic
By the 1890s, Waffling was already one of most notable wizards of the date,[4][5] so it is more than likely he published some of his writings before this point. Around this time Albus Dumbledore, the "most brilliant student ever seen [at Hogwarts]", was in regular correspondence with Waffling in order to exchange ideas about magic.[4] Minerva McGonagall later shared these letters with members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force who pursued a Professorship profession to help improve their skills in addressing the Calamity.[6]
Waffling died in 1981.[1]
Behind the scenes
In early editions of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, A History of Magic is incorrectly said to be written by Adalbert Waffling, instead of Bathilda Bagshot.
In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, it is revealed that Albus Dumbledore corresponded with Waffling during his time at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. However, the dates given for Waffling's birth on his Chocolate Frog Card say that he was born after Dumbledore graduated (in 1899).
Adalbert Waffling's death date coincides with the height of the First Wizarding War and the original downfall of Lord Voldemort. It is unknown if he died as a result of the war, or died of another reason.
Etymology
Adal is Old High German for "noble" or "aristocratic"; berta, "bright". "Waffling" means speaking or writing at length in a vague or trivial manner without a clear point or aim.
