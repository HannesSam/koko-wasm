"Well, the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel, because all three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792, when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage. It's all in Hogwarts, A History."
— Hermione Granger[src]
This individual (fl. 1792) was a Headteacher of Durmstrang Institute during the 1790s.[1]
Biography
In 1792, the Triwizard Tournament was held at Hogwarts Castle, and this Headteacher and the Durmstrang student delegation travelled to Scotland, along with the Head of Beauxbatons, and were welcomed by the Head of Hogwarts. One of the tasks involved catching a Cockatrice, which went on a rampage and injured the judges, including the Durmstrang Head. This incident, along with the rising number of deaths, was a contributing factor to the eventual disbandment of the Tournament, though there were a few unsuccessful attempts to revive it.[1]
Appearances
