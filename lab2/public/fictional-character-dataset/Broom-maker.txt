"Brooms tended to be hand-produced by individual broom-makers, and while they are admirable from the point of view of styling and craftmanship, their performance rarely matched up to their handsome appearance."
— Kennilworthy Whisp, Quidditch Through the Ages[src]

History
Up until the early 20th century, most broomsticks were created by individual broom-makers. These broomsticks were well made and aesthetically pleasing, but were not as fast or reliable as more modern broomsticks. Early broom-makers also had the issues of keeping up with the massive demand for their products, and often quickly went out of business. With the founding of the Cleansweep Broom Company in 1926, broomstick making companies became more common, as they could keep up with the demand and produce a more consistent product, and individual broom-makers appear to have largely vanished.[1]
However, even into the 1980s there may have still been a market for bespoke broom makers, as Rowan Khanna mentioned that their uncle was a top broom maker. Crafting a single broom would take him a few months and the product would cost a few thousand galleons. [2]
