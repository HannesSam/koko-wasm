Etymology
The name "Emily" is an English feminine form of Aemilius. In the English-speaking world it was not common until after the German House of Hanover came to the British throne in the 18th century; the princess Amelia Sophia (1711-1786) was commonly known as Emily in English, even though Amelia is an unrelated name. Famous bearers include the British author Emily Brontë (1818-1848), who wrote Wuthering Heights, and the American poet Emily Dickinson (1830-1886).
