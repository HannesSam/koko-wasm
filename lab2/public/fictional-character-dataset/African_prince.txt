"His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story."
— Alleged African prince[src]
An African prince allegedly gifted Quirinus Quirrell with a turban as a token of his gratitude after the professor had rid him of a bothersome zombie.[2]
Behind the scenes
Although Quirinus Quirrell claimed to have received his turban from this individual,[2] Quirrell used the turban to hide the face of Lord Voldemort on the back of his head.[3] Therefore, it is possible that this individual does not exist, particularly as there are no wizarding princes,[4] and it would be odd if a Muggle prince knew about a zombie. Additionally, zombies are known to be native to the United States of America,[5] as opposed to the continent of Africa.

Notes and references
↑ Remus Lupin states in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 16 (A Very Frosty Christmas) that there are no wizarding princes, and thus this prince must have inherited his nobility from Muggle ancestors.
