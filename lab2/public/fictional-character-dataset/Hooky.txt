"Hooky the House-Elf!"
— Hermione Granger after finding his statue[src]
Hooky was a famous house-elf,[1] though what he achieved or was well-known for is unknown.
History
A small statue of Hooky was located in the dungeons of Hogwarts Castle, at the bottom of a corridor full of Wiggenweld Potions, Potions equipment, and ingredients. However, it is unlikely that he worked there at the school due to Hermione Granger's absent knowledge of his kind in the castle.[1]
Hooky's statue was one of those required by Hermione in order to complete a challenge set by Fred and George Weasley during the 1993–1994 school year. Every time she found a set of three statues, she was allowed to read a chapter of The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection.[1]
