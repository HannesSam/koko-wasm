Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill (30 November, 1874 – 24 January, 1965) was the Muggle Prime Minister from 10 May, 1940 to 26 July, 1945 and again from 26 October, 1951 to 6 April, 1955. Churchill was widely regarded as one of the greatest wartime leaders, due to Britain's involvement in the Second World War.[1]
Winston Churchill enjoyed a good working relationship with the Minister for Magic, Leonard Spencer-Moon, as they oversaw a period of great international turmoil in both the wizarding (global wizarding war) and the Muggle world (Second World War).[2]
Behind the scenes
To this day, six different actors who have appeared in the Harry Potter film series have portrayed Winston Churchill:
The late Robert Hardy (who played Cornelius Fudge) played Churchill in the 1981 drama Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years, the television-film The Woman He Loved, the mini-series War and Remembrance (both released in 1988) and in the Agatha Christe's Marple episode 'The Sittaford Mystery'.
The late David Ryall (who played Elphias Doge in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1) portrayed Churchill in the 2002 television film Bertie & Elizabeth, the 2002 film Two Men Went to War (in which Robert Hardy played US President Franklin D. Roosevelt) and in the 2006 French miniseries Le Grand Charles.
Brendan Gleeson (who played Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody) played Churchill in the 2009 biopic Into the Storm.
Timothy Spall (who played Peter Pettigrew) portrayed Churchill in the 2010 film The King's Speech.
Michael Gambon (who played Albus Dumbledore) played Churchill in the 2016 television film Churchill's Secret.
Gary Oldman (who played Sirius Black) portrayed Churchill in the 2017 biopic Darkest Hour. Oldman's performance, which was considered by many critics as one of the best in his career, earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor.
