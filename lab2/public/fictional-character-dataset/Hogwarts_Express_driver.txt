The Hogwarts Express driver was the individual who drove the Hogwarts Express from Platform Nine and Three-Quarters to the Hogsmeade station.[2][3]
History
On 1 September 1991, Hermione Granger once asked the Hogwarts Express driver when they would be arriving at Hogwarts. The driver claimed that they were nearly there.[2]
On 1 September 1993, the Hogwarts Express trolley witch assured the trio that she would be up with the Hogwarts Express driver if Remus Lupin woke and was hungry. On the same day, Hermione went to ask the driver why the train had stopped when dementors were searching the train for Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin also went to speak to the same individual.[3]
