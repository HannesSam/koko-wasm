"Do you know there's a wizard, in Nepal, who's growing gravity-resistant trees"
— Neville Longbottom to Harry Potter[src]
A wizard from Nepal, with some Herbology skill, bred gravity-resistant trees. He was notable enough to be included in Goshawk's Guide to Herbology by Miranda Goshawk by 1994, although any activity in the field since that time is unknown.[1]
