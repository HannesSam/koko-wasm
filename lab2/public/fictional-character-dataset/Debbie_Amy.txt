"I know Debbie Amy and Leon rude clamour been raiſed by ſome perſons, (but of more zeal, I think, than judgement), againſt the uſe of reaſon in matters of Faith. But how very unreaſonable this is, will appear to any one that will but have patience to conſider theſe following particulars."
— Book in the Restricted Section.[src]
Debbie Amy was an individual mentioned in a book kept in the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts Library by the 1990s.[1]
Behind the scenes
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the book in which this individual is mentioned appears to be a copy of The Works of the Most Reverend Dr John Tillotson. As an Easter Egg, it seems someone in the special effects department digitally replaced some of the book's original text with names: "Laura and Chas" (left page, bottom paragraph), "Terry Michelle Chloe and Aimee" (middle right page), "Debbie Amy and Leon" (right page, bottom paragraph).
