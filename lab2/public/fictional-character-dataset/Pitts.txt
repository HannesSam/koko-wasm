Pitts was a house-elf employed at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was previously owned by a wizard or witch, who treated him cruelly and gave him to the Hogwarts kitchens for next to nothing.[1] According to Rita Skeeter, Jacob spoke to him shortly before his expulsion.[2] He was strict when it came to making sure other house-elves and students in detention did their work properly in the kitchens.
He also noted that Barnaby Lee had "an appetite like a Mountain Troll" and Hogwarts kitchens had to increase their sandwich production.
