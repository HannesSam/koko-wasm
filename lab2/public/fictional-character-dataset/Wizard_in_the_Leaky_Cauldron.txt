Magical abilities and skills
Wandless magic: This wizard was capable of stirring a cup of coffee magically by simply using his hand, which is highly advanced and difficult magic to accomplish.[1]
Behind the scenes
This wizard was portrayed by Ian Brown in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in a celebrity cameo.
His reading of a book titled A Brief History of Time is likely foreshadowing for the use of time travel later in the film. 
Said book was published in 1990 in real life. Therefore, it can't be suggested as a proof that the wizard might actually be a time traveller himself since the scene is placed in 1993.
He does not appear in the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban book.
