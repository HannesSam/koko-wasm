"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?"
"Well, Ted, I don’t know about that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight."
— Ted and Jim McGuffin[src]
Ted was a Muggle television newsreader in 1981, working alongside Jim McGuffin. Following the downfall of Lord Voldemort, he reported on the unusual amount of owl activity during the day as messages were passed throughout the Wizarding world, while being unaware that the activity was a result of the celebrations of Lord Voldemort's apparent demise.[1]
