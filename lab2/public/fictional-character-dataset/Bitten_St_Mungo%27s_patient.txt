This British witch came into St Mungo's in 1995 because a magical creature had taken a bite out of her leg but she also refused to tell the Healers what it was that bit her. This made the other patients think that she may have been illegally handling a creature. Arthur Weasley noted that the bite smelt highly unpleasant whenever the dressings were taken off.[1]
Her bed in St Mungo's was near the door of the Dai Llewellyn Ward when Harry Potter, Mad-Eye Moody, Nymphadora Tonks and the Weasley family went to see Arthur Weasley.[1]
